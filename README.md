# Bitcoin-Arbitrage

This is an in-depth analysis on Bitcoin arbitrage opportunities from Q1 2018. I chose 3 days, 2018-01-28, 2018-02-15 and 2018-03-28 and used jupyter lab to explore pandas and displaying dataframes. Through this exploration I found profitable trades, specifically on the first day 2018-01-28.
