# Bitcoin-Arbitrage


![Bitcoin image](Bitcoin image.png)



This is an in-depth analysis on Bitcoin arbitrage opportunities from Q1 2018. I chose 3 days, 2018-01-28, 2018-02-15 and 2018-03-28 and used jupyter lab to explore pandas and displaying dataframes. Through this exploration I found profitable trades, specifically on the first day 2018-01-28.

## Technologies 

This Analysis uses Python 3.7 with the following packages:

``` pandas ```

``` pathlib ```

``` %matplotlib ```

``` numpy ```

``` python 3.7 ```

``` jupyter lab ```

---
## Installations

This analysis was done with Pandas on Jupyter Lab. To interact with the functions, first install the following:

``` pip jupyter lab ```

``` pip install python 3.7 ```

---
## Usage

This is an analysis of Bitcoin Arbitrage Opportunities that existed back in 2018. There are functions that interact with the pandas library inside jupyter lab. Theoritically the functions could be used with other csv files or datasets. Also the functions could be used with a more contemporary file, and updated to real time. All you need to do is change the path in the first cell in jupyter lab to the path to your current csv file, and viola. All the functions would work to find a current Bitcoin Arbitrage opportunity. So although this is an analysis from back in 2018, it absolutely could be updated to find recent Arbitrage opportunities .
